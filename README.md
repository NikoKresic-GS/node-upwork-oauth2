# Application Integration
To integrate this library you need to have:

* Node.JS >= 4
* npm >= 3.5.0

## Example
In addition to this, a full example is available in the `example` directory. 
This includes `example.js` that gets an access token and requests the data
for applications that are not web-based.
It also describes how to use your own client together with this Upwork library.

## Installation

To install the library please run the following command:

    $ npm install @upwork/node-upwork-oauth2

## Quick start

Before you start using Upwork API, you will need to obtain your pair of API keys.
Visit the `Upwork API documentation Center <https://developers.upwork.com/#authentication_oauth-20>`_
for full details.

1. `example/example.js` to `myapp.js`
2. open `myapp.js` and type the clientId (a.k.a. consumer key), clientSecret (a.k.a. client secret) and `redirectUri` that you previously got from the API Center.

***That's all. Run your app as `node myapp.js` and have fun.***
